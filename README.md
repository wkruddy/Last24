###Monitor your shit, dawg!

This is a little app that let's you keep track of your SCRUM team's daily standup + analytics.

## Installation

Once you've cloned the repo, you'll want to run `yarn` and then when that's done, run `yarn start` to start serving on port 4000.

## Caveats

Right now, this only saves to your local storage on the browser, which is pretty meh. Working on implementing Lerna and Last24-Service Node layer.

## Future Updates

- Add hooks for MongoDB to save (or MySQL with some Python depending on if I can get my hosting provider to let me use Node without a VPS... but... Node is easier for now).
- Styling (I currently have UX designer redesigining it)
- Actual Analytics on your teammates
- Team-based and User settings, a splash screen, and movement to React Native.
